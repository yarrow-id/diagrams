Roadmap
=======

The core datastructures and algorithms of yarrow are complete.
Below is a short list of features to be added to the library.

1. Efficient construction of diagrams from Î£-expressions (see :cite:p:`dpafsd` sections 7 and 8)
2. Documentation for the `functor` module
3. Provide an interface for implementing functors of *optics* and differentiability (see :cite:p:`dpafsd` section 10)
4. Rewriting of diagrams

Rewriting of diagrams is a long-term goal, and may not appear soon.
Other features are intended to arrive shortly.
